You are a research assistant helping me select datasets for an AI system that predicts air quality 6h/12h/24h ahead and generates (1) health recommendations and (2) policy recommendations (government).

Goal:
- Primary target locations: Cairo (Egypt) and Zagazig (Egypt) — prioritize any dataset that contains these cities or nearby stations.
- Also require global coverage to train a generalized model.
- Pollutants needed (hourly preferred): PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, SO2, CO (plus any extra like temperature, humidity, wind if available).
- Need historical data long enough for ML (ideally years), and preferably near-real-time updates for deployment.
- I can combine multiple sources (ground stations + reanalysis/satellite + weather).

Tasks:
1) Find and list the best candidate datasets/APIs that provide the pollutants above globally (station-level or gridded), and explicitly confirm whether Cairo and Zagazig appear (or the nearest available stations/coverage).
2) For each candidate, extract:
   - Provider + dataset name
   - Coverage (global/region), spatial resolution (station vs grid + grid size), temporal resolution (hourly/daily), historical span (start–end)
   - Pollutants included (PM2.5/PM10/NO2/O3/SO2/CO)
   - Access method (API/bulk download), rate limits, cost (free/paid), and license/terms (commercial allowed?)
   - Data quality notes (official monitors vs low-cost sensors, QA flags, missingness)
   - Direct citation/links to official documentation pages
3) Build a recommended “data stack” for my use case:
   - A) Global training baseline dataset(s)
   - B) Egypt-specific / Cairo+Zagazig enhancement dataset(s)
   - C) Deployment-time data sources (real-time / near-real-time)
4) Provide a final ranked recommendation with rationale and risks (e.g., Zagazig data scarcity, licensing restrictions, station coverage gaps).

Output format:
- Start with a ranked table (top 8–12 sources).
- Then a short “recommended architecture” section (how to fuse sources for 6/12/24h forecasting).
- Include citations for every non-trivial claim.
Use web browsing. Prefer official documentation and reputable sources over blogs.








..........................................................................................
You are a senior environmental data scientist and research analyst.

I am building an AI system for:
* Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction at 6h, 12h, and 24h horizons and  Dataset for past 3 years to train on that with timestamps.
* Health recommendations (population-level + sensitive groups)
* Policy recommendations (government / urban planning / alerts)

This is a NON-COMMERCIAL research project.
I allow BOTH free and paid datasets.
My priority is data quality, coverage, and scientific credibility.

========================
PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS
========================
Target locations (highest priority):
* Cairo, Egypt
* Zagazig, Egypt (very important — explicitly verify availability or nearest alternatives)

Global requirement:
* I also need worldwide data to train a generalized model (transfer learning / pretraining).

Pollutants (hourly preferred):
* PM2.5
* PM10
* NO2
* O3
* SO2
* CO

Helpful auxiliary variables (if available):
* Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, pressure
* Boundary layer height, radiation, precipitation
* Timestamps, station metadata (lat/lon, elevation)

Historical depth:
* Multi-year historical data suitable for ML time-series modeling
* Near-real-time or forecast access is a strong plus

========================
YOUR TASKS
========================

1️⃣ DATASET DISCOVERY  
Search and identify the BEST datasets/APIs that provide the pollutants above:
* Global station-level data
* Global gridded/reanalysis data
* Satellite-derived products (if useful)
* Weather-linked air quality products

Explicitly confirm:
* Whether Cairo appears directly
* Whether Zagazig appears directly
* If Zagazig is missing, identify the closest stations AND/OR gridded coverage that can reasonably represent it

2️⃣ DATASET EVALUATION (FOR EACH SOURCE)
For every candidate dataset, extract and present:
* Provider + dataset name
* Coverage (global / regional)
* Spatial resolution (station vs grid + grid size)
* Temporal resolution (hourly / daily)
* Historical span (start → end year)
* Pollutants included (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, SO2, CO)
* Access method (API / bulk download)
* Cost (free / paid) and licensing (explicitly note non-commercial allowance)
* Data quality notes (official monitors vs low-cost sensors, QA/QC flags)
* Direct links to official documentation (NOT blogs)

3️⃣ RANKING & SHORTLIST
Produce:
* A ranked table of the top 8–12 datasets best suited for my goals
* Clearly explain WHY each dataset ranks where it does

4️⃣ RECOMMENDED “DATA STACK”
Design a **practical data fusion strategy**:
* A) Global baseline dataset(s) for model training
* B) Egypt-specific enhancement for Cairo & Zagazig
* C) Real-time / near-real-time sources for deployment
* D) Weather data integration for forecasting (lags + exogenous variables)

5️⃣ ZAGAZIG FALLBACK STRATEGY (VERY IMPORTANT)
If direct station data for Zagazig is unavailable:
* Propose a scientifically sound workaround using:
  - Reanalysis or satellite products
  - Nearby cities/stations
  - Spatial interpolation or downscaling
* Explain limitations and uncertainty

6️⃣ FINAL RECOMMENDATION
Conclude with:
* The BEST overall dataset combination for my use case
* Risks, gaps, and mitigation strategies
* What I should download FIRST and why

========================
OUTPUT FORMAT
========================
* Start with a ranked comparison table
* Follow with clear sections (Dataset Stack, Zagazig Strategy, Final Recommendation)
* Be concise but technically rigorous
* Cite official sources for every non-trivial claim
* Prefer authoritative providers (e.g., Copernicus, OpenAQ, ECMWF, NOAA, etc.)

Use web browsing and deep search.
Assume I am technically skilled and want research-grade results.
